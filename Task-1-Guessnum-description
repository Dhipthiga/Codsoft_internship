ğŸ”¶Guess Number Game
This project is a simple Java-based number guessing game. 

Below is a brief overview of how the game works:

ğŸ”¹Objective: The player must guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100.
ğŸ”¹Attempts: The player is given a maximum of 3 attempts to guess the correct number.
ğŸ”¹Clue Feature:
  1. The player has the option to receive clues.
  2. If clues are enabled, hints will be provided after each guess, indicating whether the correct number is higher or lower than the guessed number.
  3. If clues are disabled, the player must guess without any hints.
ğŸ”¹Random Number Generation: The game generates a random number using Javaâ€™s Random class.
ğŸ”¹Game Flow:
  a. The player is prompted to guess a number.
  b. If the guess is correct, a congratulatory message is displayed, along with the number of attempts it took.
  c. If the player does not guess the correct number within three attempts, the game ends, revealing the correct number.
  d.This project demonstrates basic concepts in Java, such as user input handling, control structures, and random number generation.
