ğŸ”¶Temperature Conversion Program - Extended Description
ğŸ”¸Program Purpose: The program is designed to convert temperatures between three different units: Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.
ğŸ”¸User Input: The program prompts the user to enter a temperature value. It also asks the user to specify the unit of the temperature (Celsius, Fahrenheit, or Kelvin).
ğŸ”¸Input Validation:
        ğŸ”¹The program accepts the unit as a character input (C for Celsius, F for Fahrenheit, and K for Kelvin).
        ğŸ”¹It converts the input to uppercase to handle case insensitivity.
        ğŸ”¹If the user enters an invalid unit, an error message is displayed.

ğŸ”¸Temperature Conversion Logic:
        ğŸ”¹The program utilizes a switch statement to determine which conversion method to use based on the input unit.
        ğŸ”¹Each conversion method is responsible for converting the given temperature to the other two units.

ğŸ”¸Includes error handling for invalid unit inputs.
